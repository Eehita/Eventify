# Eventify

## What does the application do?
Eventify provides one simple platform for event planning by using location. Event organizers and attendees can sign up on the application and there are several distinct functionalities available for both - the Organizers and the Attendees. We are working on developing both - a Web and Android application for Eventify.
  
## Why did we create this application?
The sphere of Event Planning is huge and we wanted to do our bit in making this process much simpler. We realized this was possible by creating a platform that was freely available to all people and aids in the process of creating events. One of our main features is HYPE that gives the organizer an idea of the number of people attending the event .i.e. the level of interest. 

## Description of Application   
--> For Event Attendees, once a person signs up for the application, he/she can see the events happening around the area they are currently in. The individual has the option to browse through categories and search for events according to date, time, location. Attendees can RSVP accordingly and express interest (using HYPE feature). 
--> For Event Organizers, once a person signs up for the application, he/she can see the events happening around the area they are currently in. Organizers can create events and edit their event page according to his/her convenience. Once the event has been created on Eventify, a feature exists such that it can be shared on Facebook or added to Google calendar or added to Microsoft Calendar. The HYPE feature gives the organizers an idea of how interested people are in their event and the data  of previous events created by them will be saved on the application (analytics like HYPE for the event, number of people who attended the event, etc.).
--> A discussion forum also exists for the attendees to interact with each other and/or the organizer (staying Anonymous will be an option). 
  
## Features in brief 
--> Event Organizers:
1. Create events and have it displayed on a map.
2. See attendee analytics (HYPE feature) on our web portal.
3. Discussion Forum for Event Organizers.

--> Event Attendees:
1. Events separated into categories to narrow the list of options available.
2. See a realtime updated event list near you including the level of interest expressed.
3. Discussion Forum for Event Attendees.

## Audience for this event
We would like this application to be used by everyone. We believe it would be especially useful for college students because the application provides an easy way to integrate the many events happening on campus at any point of time.

## Future Goals
1. Surprise Me feature that suggests events the user can attend depending on previous preferences or otherwise.
2. Check-In feature that enables a person to prove that they are definitely attending the event once at a distance of 40 metres from the event. And, once checked in, a QR code would be generated on the individual's phone. This would greatly help the organizers to keep a track on who attended the event. 
2. Providing the option to book places for Event Organizers. We hope to provide a real-time updated list of places that people can book for their events on the application to make the process of Event Planning even more simplified. 
3. We'd like to increase the scale of our project such that the map generated to shows events that are not only created on Eventify but elsewhere. So, users will have a complete experience of what is happening around their area.
